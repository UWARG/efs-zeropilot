 * @brief
 * Contains generic implementation of a byte queue. This is used extensively where
 * a character buffer is required, such as in the UART implementation. This is an 
 * array based queue that will increase in size by 2x if it becomes full and if
 * its max size allows it. It will shrink in half if its a quarter full.
