/**
*   
*   Airspeed sensor functions
*
*   This header is an outline of basic functions of the airspeed
*   sensor. Generally, this sensor is a Pitot tube which uses a 
*   pressure differential to determine airspeed. 
*
*   Airspeed calculation should be done and returned in meters 
*   per second
